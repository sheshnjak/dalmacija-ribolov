      <div id="srdela" class="podstranica"><h1>Pilchard</h1>
  <p>Pilchard or sardine (Latin Sardina pilchardus) is   economically one of the most important fish of the Adriatic Sea. The   annual catch of sardines is almost 60% of the total Adriatic catch of   marine fish. Sardine meat is very savory and nourishing due to a   significant percentage of fat, and therefore very popular seafood.   Sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce the occurrence of   cardiovascular disease. </p>
  <p><a href="slike/srdela.jpg" title="Pilchard : lat. Sardina Pilchardus" rel="lbx-proizvod" class="ovaj"><img src="slike/t_srdela.jpg" alt="Pilchard" class="desno" /></a>In the past, sardines had an important role in the traditional menu of our ancestors. Although it has historically been   known as poors food, sardines are valued by connoisseurs — especially   the famous Croatian brined pilchard. Fishing for sardela or sardina (<em>Sardina pilchardus</em>) on the coasts of Dalmatia and Istria began thousands of years ago. The   region was part of the Roman Empire, and has always been sustained through fishing mainly sardines. All along the coast there are many   towns that promote the age-old practice of fishing by lateen sail boats for tourism and on festival occasions. Today, our industrial producers continue this tradition. </p>
  <p>Pilchard as a fish species reaches up to 24 cm in length and a weight   of 0.08 kg. Average caught weight is about 0.03 kg (30-35 pieces per 1   kg). Pilchard has a well developed tail and dorsal fin. The upper side   is oliveblue colored with a large longitudinal blue belt on each side,   while the lower side is silver. Pilchard schools are spreaded on almost entire  Adriatic   coast. Although uniformly distributed, dense settlements concentrate on   two hunting areas: central—southern Dalmatian islands and the North and   Kvarner region. </p>
  <p>The most important gear is an encircling net, particularly   the purse seine. Many modifications of encircling nets are used,   including traps or weirs. The latter are stationary enclosures composed   of stakes into which   schools of sardines are diverted as they swim   along the coast. The fish are caught mainly at night, when they approach   the surface to feed on plankton. After harvesting, the fish are   immediately &quot;shocked&quot; by submerging in ice to preserve freshness.</p>

<div id="incun" class="podstranica"><h1>Anchovy</h1>
    <p>European Anchovy (Latin Engraulis Encrasicolus) is the main   commercial anchovy species in Adriatic sea. It belongs to family   Engraulidae similar to pilchard or herring, but they are found away from   shore (real pelagic fish). They are found in scattered areas throughout   the world's oceans, but are concentrated in temperate waters, and are   rare or absent in very cold or very warm seas. </p>
    <p><a href="slike/incun.jpg" title="Anchovy : lat. Engraulis Encrasicolus" rel="lbx-proizvod" class="ovaj"><img src="slike/t_incun.jpg" alt="Anchovy" class="livo" /></a>Large schools can be found in shallow, brackish areas with   muddy bottoms, as in   estuaries and bays. Anchovies are abundant in the   Mediterranean. In Adriatic sea it is found areas not deeper than 300 m,   but mostly concentrated in areas with depth between 30 and 100 m. It   grows up to 20 cm and weighs about 0,05 kg. The upper side is oliveblue   colored with a large longitudinal blue belt on each side, while the   lower side is silver.</p>
    <p>Economically, anchovies are very significant species in Adriatic   fishing. Historically it was not as significant as the pilchard because   it was harder to navigate to its pelagic settlements, but with modern   fishing boats and equipment it became important. Most of caught   anchovies are processed and exported, but we mainly use it as tuna food   and only surplus is processed and marketed. It is caught similar way as   pilchard, with the same tools.</p>
</div>
<div id="tuna" class="podstranica"><h1>Bluefin tuna</h1>
    <p>Name tuna is very old, and it takes roots from Ancient Greek philosopher   and scientist Aristotel. Even in those  old times Aristotel was fascinated by tuna's long and fast swimming abilities. Name tuna   translated form old Greek would be a &quot;hasty wanderer&quot;. There are   historical documents from that time that describe tuna fishing in Adriatic Sea, and  tastiness of tuna's meat.</p>
    <p><a href="slike/tuna.jpg" title="Bluefin tuna : lat. Thunnus Thynnus" rel="lbx-proizvod" class="ovaj"><img src="slike/t_tuna.jpg" alt="srdela" class="desno" /></a>Tuna is a carnivore, primarily feeding of small bluefish species like   pilchard and mackerel. It is one of the rare endothermic (warm-blooded)   fish, and in contrary of dry land endothermic animals it doesn't keep   it's body temperature inside narrow margin. Tuna's body temperature   changes with  water temperature, enabling it to migrate between very   different environments, so tuna can be found from warm seas like   Mediterranean  or Caribbean  to the cold coasts of Norway or Labrador. </p>
    <p>Their metallic blue coloring on top and shimmering  silver–white   on the bottom helps camouflage them from above and below. Their   torpedo-shaped, streamlined bodies are built for speed and  endurance.   Even submarine engineers studied their shape and swimming mechanism.   They even have several stability fins towards their tail. Bluefin tuna   has very effective circulatory system with high hemoglobin concentration   and exceptionally thin water-blood barrier that enables efficient   oxygen intake.</p>
